<p>Data frames are the <em>de facto</em> data structure for most tabular data, and what we use for statistics and plotting.</p>
<p>A data frame can be created by hand, but most commonly they are generated by the functions <code>read.csv()</code> or <code>read.table()</code>; in other words, when importing spreadsheets from your hard drive (or the web).</p>
<p>A data frame is the representation of data in the format of a table where the columns are vectors that all have the same length. Because columns are vectors, each column must contain a single type of data (e.g., characters, integers, factors).</p>
<p>We can see this when inspecting the <b>str</b>ucture of a data frame with the function <code>str()</code>:</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="inspecting-data.frame-objects">Inspecting <code>data.frame</code> Objects</h2>
<p>We already saw how the functions <code>head()</code> and <code>str()</code> can be useful to check the content and the structure of a data frame. Here is a non-exhaustive list of functions to get a sense of the content/structure of the data. Let’s try them out!</p>
<p><strong>Size</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dim(nhanes)</code> - returns a vector with the number of rows as the first element, and the number of columns as the second element (the <strong>dim</strong>ensions of the object).</li>
<li><code>nrow(nhanes)</code> - returns the number of rows.</li>
<li><code>ncol(nhanes)</code> - returns the number of columns.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Content</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>head(nhanes)</code> - shows the first 6 rows.</li>
<li><code>tail(nhanes)</code> - shows the last 6 rows.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Names</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>names(nhanes)</code> - returns the column names (synonym of <code>colnames()</code> for <code>data.frame</code> objects).</li>
<li><code>rownames(nhanes)</code> - returns the row names.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>str(nhanes)</code> - structure of the object and information about the class, length and content of each column.</li>
<li><code>summary(nhanes)</code> - summary statistics for each column.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: most of these functions are “generic”, they can be used on other types of objects besides <code>data.frame</code>.</p>

<p>Instead of <code>read.csv()</code>, we will read in our data using the <code>read_csv()</code> function (notice the <code>_</code> instead of the <code>.</code>), from the tidyverse package <strong><code>readr</code></strong>.</p>

<p>Notice that the class of the data is now referred to as a “tibble”.</p>
<p>Tibbles tweak some of the behaviors of the data frame objects we introduced in the previously. The data structure is very similar to a data frame. For our purposes the only differences are that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It displays the data type of each column under its name. Note that &lt;<code>dbl</code>&gt; is a data type defined to hold numeric values with decimal points.</p></li>
<li><p>It only prints the first few rows of data and only as many columns as fit on one screen.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We are now going to learn some of the most common <strong><code>dplyr</code></strong> functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>select()</code>: subset columns</li>
<li><code>filter()</code>: subset rows on conditions</li>
<li><code>mutate()</code>: create new columns by using information from other columns</li>
<li><code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarise()</code>: create summary statistics on grouped data</li>
<li><code>arrange()</code>: sort results</li>
<li><code>count()</code>: count discrete values</li>
</ul>

<p>What if you want to select and filter at the same time? There are three ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes.</p>
<p>With intermediate steps, you create a temporary data frame and use that as input to the next function, like this:</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>This is readable, but can clutter up your workspace with lots of intermediate objects that you have to name individually. With multiple steps, that can be hard to keep track of.</p>
<p>You can also nest functions (i.e.&nbsp;one function inside of another), like this:</p>
<div class="cell">

<p>This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested, as R evaluates the expression from the inside out (in this case, filtering, then selecting).</p>
<p>The last option, <em>pipes</em>, are a recent addition to R. Pipes let you take the output of one function and send it directly to the next, which is useful when you need to do many things to the same dataset.</p>
<p>Pipes in R look like <code>%&gt;%</code> (made available via the <strong><code>magrittr</code></strong> package) or <code>|&gt;</code> (through base R). If you use RStudio, you can type the pipe with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a PC or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> if you have a Mac.</p>
<p>In the above code, we use the pipe to send the <code>nhanes</code> dataset first through <code>filter()</code> to keep rows where <code>sex</code> is Male, then through <code>select()</code> to keep only the selected columns.</p>
<p>The pipe <code>%&gt;%</code> takes the object on its left and passes it directly as the first argument to the function on its right, we don’t need to explicitly include the data frame as an argument to the <code>filter()</code> and <code>select()</code> functions any more.</p>

<p>Some may find it helpful to read the pipe like the word “then”. For instance, in the above example, we took the data frame <code>rna</code>, <em>then</em> we <code>filter</code>ed for rows with <code>sex == "Male"</code>, <em>then</em> we <code>select</code>ed columns <code>sex</code>, <code>age.years</code>, <code>dental.decay.present</code>, and <code>hba1c</code>.</p>
<p>The <strong><code>dplyr</code></strong> functions by themselves are somewhat simple, but by combining them into linear workflows with the pipe, we can accomplish more complex manipulations of data frames.</p>
<p>If we want to create a new object with this smaller version of the data, we can assign it a new name:</p>

<p>For some data, we might want to visualize things with a table instead of a plot. We can use the <code>table</code> builtin function to easily tabulate age by dental caries.</p>
<div class="cell">
<div class="sourceCode cell-code" id="cb32"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb32-1"><a href="#cb32-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="fu">table</span>(nhanes_processed[,<span class="fu">c</span>(<span class="st">"RIDAGEYR"</span>,<span class="st">"dental.caries"</span>)])</span></code><button title="Copy to Clipboard" class="code-copy-button"><i class="bi"></i></button></pre></div>
<div class="cell-output cell-output-stdout">

</div>
<p>However, we can also take advantage of packages written for this purpose. For instance, we can quickly make a frequency table using the <code>proc_freq</code> function in <code>flextable</code>.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="first-steps-with-ggplot2">First steps with ggplot2</h2>
<p><strong>ggplot2</strong> is the most popular data visualisation R package. Its <code>ggplot()</code> function is at the core of this package, and this whole approach is colloquially known as <em>“ggplot”</em> with the resulting figures sometimes affectionately called “ggplots”. The “gg” in these names reflects the “<strong>g</strong>rammar of <strong>g</strong>raphics” used to construct the figures. <strong>ggplot2</strong> benefits from a wide variety of supplementary R packages that further enhance its functionality.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf">data visualization with ggplot cheatsheet</a> from the RStudio website is a great reference to have on-hand when creating pltos. If you want inspiration for ways to creatively visualise your data, we suggest reviewing websites like the <a href="https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/">R graph gallery</a> and <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/caveats.html">Data-to-viz</a>.</p>
<p>We can summarize the ggplot approach as:</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="mapping-variables">Mapping Variables</h2>
<p>Beyond the actual axes we can use mappings to encode variables as various aspects of a plot. Some of the most commonly used other mapping types are <code>shape</code>, <code>fill</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>size</code>, and <code>linetype</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, let’s take our scatterplot from before and color the points by diabetic status.</p>

<p>It is difficult to tell how many diabetic participants are in this plot, as it’s possible that the red diabetic points have been covered by the blue and green points. We can alter the transparency of the points by changing <code>alpha</code>. Remember we can also change parts of the plot outside of <code>aes()</code> to have them not depend on any variable.</p>

<p>As with everything else, there are a variety of ways to create maps in R. Let’s look at 2 examples, creating simple maps with the <code>maps</code> package and importing a shapefile using the <code>sf</code> package.</p>
<p>For simple information we want to see on a standard map, we can use the <code>maps</code> package. For instance, we can grab a map of the USA and plot some coordinates.</p>

<p>We use the package <code>sf</code> (spatial features) and its function <code>st_as_sf()</code> to create the new object we call <code>linelist_sf</code>. This new object looks essentially the same as the <code>linelist</code>, but the columns <code>lon</code> and <code>lat</code> have been designated as coordinate columns, and a coordinate reference system (CRS) has been assigned for when the points are displayed.</p>

<h2 data-anchor-id="exporting-plots">Exporting plots</h2>
<p>Exporting ggplots is made easy with the <code>ggsave()</code> function from <strong>ggplot2</strong>. It can work in two ways, either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specify the name of the plot object, then the file path and name with extension
<ul>
<li>For example: <code>ggsave(my_plot, "plots/my_plot.png"))</code><br>
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Run the command with only a file path, to save the last plot that was printed
<ul>
<li>For example: <code>ggsave("plots/my_plot.png"))</code></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>You can export as png, pdf, jpeg, tiff, bmp, svg, or several other file types, by specifying the file extension in the file path.</p>
<p>You can also specify the arguments <code>width =</code>, <code>height =</code>, and <code>units =</code> (either “in”, “cm”, or “mm”). You can also specify <code>dpi =</code> with a number for plot resolution (e.g.&nbsp;300). See the function details by entering <code>?ggsave</code> or reading the <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html">documentation online</a>.</p>
