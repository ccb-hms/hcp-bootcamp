# Introduction 

## Why learn R?

As stated on the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is highly versatile, extendable, and community-driven.

### R does not involve lots of pointing and clicking, and that's a good thing

The learning curve might be steeper than with other software, but with
R, the results of your analysis do not rely on remembering a
succession of pointing and clicking, but instead on a series of
written commands, and that's a good thing! So, if you want to redo
your analysis because you collected more data, you don't have to
remember which button you clicked in which order to obtain your
results; you just have to run your script again.

Working with scripts makes the steps you used in your analysis clear,
and the code you write can be inspected by someone else who can give
you feedback and spot mistakes.

Working with scripts forces you to have a deeper understanding of what
you are doing, and facilitates your learning and comprehension of the
methods you use.

### R code is great for reproducibility

Reproducibility means that someone else (including your future self) can
obtain the same results from the same dataset when using the same
analysis code.

R integrates with other tools to generate manuscripts or reports from your
code. If you collect more data, or fix a mistake in your dataset, the
figures and the statistical tests in your manuscript or report are updated
automatically.

An increasing number of journals and funding agencies expect analyses
to be reproducible, so knowing R will give you an edge with these
requirements.

### R is interdisciplinary and extensible

With 10000+ packages that can be installed to extend its
capabilities, R provides a framework that allows you to combine
statistical approaches from many scientific disciplines to best suit
the analytical framework you need to analyse your data. For instance,
R has packages for image analysis, GIS, time series, population
genetics, and a lot more.


```{r, fig.cap="Exponential increase of the number of packages available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), the Comprehensive R Archive Network. From the R Journal, Volume 10/2, December 2018.", echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("img/cran.png", error=FALSE)
```

### R works on data of all shapes and sizes

The skills you learn with R scale easily with the size of your
dataset. Whether your dataset has hundreds or millions of lines, it
won't make much difference to you.

R is designed for data analysis. It comes with special data structures
and data types that make handling of missing data and statistical
factors convenient.

R can connect to spreadsheets, databases, and many other data formats,
on your computer or on the web.

### R produces high-quality graphics

The plotting functionalities in R are extensive, and allow you to adjust
any aspect of your graph to convey most effectively the message from
your data.

### R has a large and welcoming community

Thousands of people use R daily. Many of them are willing to help you
through mailing lists and websites such as [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), or on the [RStudio
community](https://community.rstudio.com/). These broad user communities
extend to specialised areas such as bioinformatics. One such subset of the R community is [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/), a scientific project for analysis and comprehension "of data from current and emerging biological assays." Another example is [R-Ladies](https://rladies.org/), a worldwide organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. It is one of the largest organizations of R users and likely has a chapter near you!

### Not only is R free, but it is also open-source and cross-platform

Anyone can inspect the source code to see how R works. Because of this
transparency, there is less chance for mistakes, and if you (or
someone else) find some, you can report and fix bugs.

# Code Notebooks {#sec-notebook}

A **code notebook** is a document which typically consists of different **chunks**. Each chunk is either code or text. There are a variety of different notebook platforms for different languages, such as Jupyter notebooks in Python. In R, notebooks have historically been written using R Markdown. Recently Quarto has been created by Posit (the organization behind RStudio) as an updated version of R Markdown. However, as Quarto still has trouble running on some older operating systems we will be using R Markdown. Quarto and R Markdown syntax are almost identical. 
R Markdown can be *rendered* do different formats such as html (a webpage viewable in your web browser), pdf, Word, powerpoint, and others. Their power lies in their ability to make code an output document. We can write our report in the same document we actually perform the analysis, integrating the two together.

## Code Chunks

You can start a and end code chunk using three back ticks "\`\`\`". To have a chunk run as R code, you need to assign the chunk using `{r}`. You can then specify options for the chunk inside the brackets, such as `{r, eval=FALSE}`. Code chunks have a lot of options, but some of the most important are `label`, `eval`, `echo`, and `output`.

```{r, label=first-code-chunk}
x <- 5
x
```


## Markdown

Markdown is a language used to quickly create formatted text. It's great to know as it is used in R Markdown, Quarto, Jupyter, Github documents, and many other places. A pure markdown file has a `.md` file extension.

- bullet
- list

1. numbered 
2. list

```{r}
3 + 4
```

You can find a quick [guide to markdown here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf), throughout the sessions we will see various things markdown can do.

# R Basics

## Creating objects in R

You can get output from R simply by typing math in the console:

```{r}
3 + 5
9 ** 6
```

However, to do useful and interesting things, we need to assign *values* to
*objects*. To create an object, we need to give it a name followed by the
assignment operator `<-` or `=`, and the value we want to give it:

```{r}
x <- 6 
y = 3

weight_kg <- 55 
```

`<-` is the assignment operator. It assigns values on the right to
objects on the left. So, after executing `x <- 3`, the value of `x` is
`3`. The arrow can be read as 3 **goes into** `x`. 
You can also use `=` for assignments.

In RStudio, typing <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>\-</kbd> (push <kbd>Alt</kbd>
at the same time as the <kbd>\-</kbd> key) will write `<-` in a single
keystroke in a PC, while typing <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>\-</kbd> (push
<kbd>Option</kbd> at the same time as the <kbd>\-</kbd> key) does the
same in a Mac.


# Packages

Command to install a package:

```{r}
# Command to install tidyverse
# install.packages("tidyverse")

# library(DT)
# datatable()
```

# Functions and their arguments

Built-in functions in R

```{r}
a <- 67
b <- a
sqrt(a)

# Trying out round's arguments

round(30.6)
round(30.6548, 2)
```

# Vectors and Data types

Numeric Vector
```{r}
weight_g <- c(50, 60, 65, 82)
weight_g[2]

```

Character Vector

```{r}
states <- c("CT", "MA", "NY")
states
```

Basic Vector operations
```{r}
weight_g[1]

1 + numeric(0)

length(states)

class(weight_kg)
class(states)

weight_g[c(1, 3)]

weight_g <- c(weight_g, 90)
weight_g <- c(30, weight_g)
ints <- c(2L, 4L)
```

Logical Vectors and Conversion

```{r}
logi_vector <- c(TRUE, FALSE, T, F)

logi_char <- c(TRUE, "a")

sum(logi_vector)

# The number of things in weight_g > 55
sum(weight_g > 55)
```

### Exercise:

What will happen in each of these examples? (hint: use `class()` to
check the data type of your objects and type in their names to see what happens):

```{r, eval=TRUE}
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE, FALSE)
char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
```

## Conditional Statements

```{r}
weight_g > 50
weight_g < 50
weight_g >= 50
weight_g <= 50

weight_g == 50

# 1. states equal to MA
states == "MA"

# 2. indexing states by the logical vector 
states[states == "MA"]

weight_g[weight_g < 70]

# OR
TRUE | TRUE
TRUE | FALSE
FALSE | TRUE
FALSE | FALSE

# AND
TRUE & TRUE
TRUE & FALSE
FALSE & TRUE
FALSE & FALSE

weight_g[(weight_g > 70 | weight_g < 50) & ((weight_g %% 3) == 0)]

states %in% c("NY", "NJ")
```

## Missing Data

Missing data is represented with `NA`. 
 
```{r}
heights <- c(2, 4, 4, NA, 6)
mean(heights, na.rm = TRUE)

na.omit(heights)

heights[!is.na(heights)]

heights[complete.cases(heights)]
```

### Exercise 

1. Using this vector of heights in inches, create a new vector with the NAs removed.

```{r}
heights <- c(63, 69, 60, 65, NA, 68, 61, 70, 61, 59, 64, 69, 63, 63, NA, 72, 65, 64, 70, 63, 65)

median(heights, na.rm = TRUE)

heights_no_na <- heights[!is.na(heights)]
median(heights_no_na, na.rm = TRUE)
```

2. Use the function `median()` to calculate the median of the `heights` vector.
3. Use R to figure out how many people in the set are taller than 67 inches.

```{r}
sum(heights[heights > 67], na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Categorical Data

# Data Frames

```{r}
# Create a data frame and store it as a variable called 'df'
ages <- c(12, 14, 14, 16, 12, 15)
is_diabetic <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
sex <- factor(c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Female"))
df <- data.frame(ages, is_diabetic, sex)
```
